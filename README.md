# 📱 Mobile Sales Intelligence System — Power BI (End-to-End Project)

This project is a real-world **Business Intelligence reporting system** built in Power BI to analyze mobile sales, customer behavior, and product performance across cities, brands, and time periods.

Instead of a single dashboard, this uses a **professional 3-layer reporting approach** — similar to enterprise BI projects.
