# Mobile-Sales-Analytics

📱 Mobile Sales Intelligence System — Power BI (End-to-End Project)

This project is a real-world style Business Intelligence solution built in Power BI to help retail leadership analyze sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends across cities, brands, and time periods.

Instead of one basic dashboard, this follows a professional 3-layer reporting structure — similar to dashboards used in enterprise BI teams.

📂 Report Pages
Page	Purpose
Executive Sales Overview	High-level KPIs, city & category performance, top products
Month-to-Date View (MTD)	Real-time month progress, model comparison, trend analysis
Same-Period Last-Year View	YoY growth comparison, seasonal trend behavior
🎯 Business Objectives

This dashboard answers key questions for business leadership:

Which cities drive the highest revenue?

Which brands & models dominate premium vs mid-segment sales?

Which payment methods are most preferred by customers?

How do customer ratings impact repeat purchase behavior?

Are sales improving vs last month/year?

This project converts raw sales data into actionable insights for sales strategy, category decisions, and customer retention planning.
